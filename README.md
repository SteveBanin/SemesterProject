# Autoencoders Project

## Purpose
### To estimate the uniqueness of test roads by using Tensorflow Autoencoders

## Approach
### I have applied the approach from the paper of Langner et al. to build out the neural networks for encoding and decoding the test routes. If a new tested route has a high error, this indicates that the route was not seen by the model before.

## How to run
* ```git clone https://github.com/SteveBanin/SemesterProject.git```
* If using Jupyter: open the `final.ipynb` file and run cells one after another
* If using Python: execute ```python final.py``` within the cloned repository
